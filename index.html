        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Thanks for visiting my site. Let me tell you a little bit about me.</p>
        <p>My name is Shaun. I work as a senior technical writer at a software company called Matillion. Before that, I worked as an SEO content writer at a business services company called Peninsula.</p>
        <p><em>Before that</em>, my first full-time job was as a digital marketing assistant at a recruitment agency called Worldwide Recruitment Solutions.</p>
        <p>Educationally, I have a Master of Arts degree in creative writing from the University of Manchester, and a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Wales, Aberystwyth&mdash;that degree is in English and creative writing.</p>
        <p>As you can see at this point, writing is basically what I spend most of my day doing in some form or another. I can't say I anticipated while doing my degrees that I would one day be writing software documentation for a living, but what I do know is:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>When I got my first iPhone, a second-hand iPhone 4 that I bought from a friend for £80 in 2014, I became very enamoured of the concept of apps. There was no precocious, prodigal "ureka!"" moment, but what there <em>was</em> was a sudden interest in how user-friendly this device I'd bought was. I enjoyed downloading apps just to try them out. I found myself curious about updates, and became someone who refreshes the App Store app every day to keep my apps updated.</li>
            <li>Reading and writing release notes is weirdly fun.</li>
            <li>Technical writing means you get to work with a whole boat-load of very clever people.</li>
            <li>It has led to me learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, and Swift. I consider myself intermediate in the first two, and a beginner in the other three. But one day...!</li>
            <li>Technical writing pays pretty damn well.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>My hobbies</h2>
        <p>When I'm not writing software documentation, I'm probably doing one of the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Reading or writing fiction. My favourite writers are <a href="https://steven-erikson.org/#blog" target="_blank">Steven Erikson</a>, William H Gass, David Foster Wallace, Tolkien, GRRM, Lucy Ellman, John Gardner (the American), and I suppose I have to say Stephen King&mdash;his Dark Tower series really made me fall in love with reading at a time when I wasn't reading a lot.</li>
            <li>Playing my bass guitar.</li>
            <li>Further learning something related to one of the programming languages listed above.</li>
            <li>Watching or playing football (soccer).</li>
            <li>Playing video games. My favourite games are Elden Ring and Returnal. I also love Skyrim, Demons Souls, Dark Souls, Pumpkin Jack, Fall Guys, Pokemon (especially Emerald), and Assassin's Creed.</li>
            <li>Watching reruns of Family Guy.</li>
            <li>Walking to remind myself that life exists <em>beyond</em> the chair.</li>
        </ul>
